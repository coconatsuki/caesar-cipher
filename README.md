I made two different versions of this App :
- the "next" version use the '.next' method for ciphering.
- the "tr" version use the ".tr" one.

==> To launch either method, use the "launch_method_next.rb" or the "launch_method_tr".

The method you choose doesn't really matter, as the final result is the same !
(The 2 methods were just a personal challenge).
