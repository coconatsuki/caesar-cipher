# Caesar Cipher

This is an exercise from the online bootcam 'The Odin Project' :

https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/building-blocks

It was meant to practice my recent and basic ruby knowledge (strings, array, hashes, conditionals, flow control...)

This application can be run on command line only.

Later on, I added some spec to practice tests. This was also part of the 'Odin Project' :

----------
I made two different versions of this App :
- the "next" version use the '.next' method for ciphering.
- the "tr" version use the ".tr" one.

==> To launch either method, use the "launch_method_next.rb" or the "launch_method_tr".

The method you choose doesn't really matter, as the final result is the same !
(The 2 methods were just a personal challenge).
